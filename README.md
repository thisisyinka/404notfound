This is my take on the devChallenges.io 404 Not Found challenge. The demo link is provided at the top of this readme file so is the solution link, which is this repo and the challenge link.

This was a relatively easy project but sometimes flexbox can get you all kinds of annoyed ðŸ˜….

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to the devChallenge link provided at the top of this document. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user story which is to display a 404 not found page.
